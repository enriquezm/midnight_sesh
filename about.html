<h3>About me.</h3>
<p>
  My name is Myles Enriquez and I am in love with music. I was born and raised in Las Vegas and have been living in Hawaii for the past 5 years.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up listening to all types of music when I was growing up. My family has always been involved with music, whether it was singing, playing instruments, rapping, or just playing music from your average stereo. Ever since I could remember, it was always about "feeling" the music and getting engulped by it. I've always been that person to tear up at beautiful symphony performances, pop and break to the bass loaded hip hop music, . You get the point. What ever kind of genre you can think of, I'm most likely into it.
</p>
<p>
  I do mix music and I have gotten into production, but because of the fact that I'm in school still, I haven't been able to devote the time I want, into actual production. I love all kinds of music, and have never really categorized it. Unless I was mixing, but other than that, there is no such thing as hip hop or house to me, it's all art.

  I you want to kind of get a feel for the music I usually listen to, go ahead and follow my soundcloud channel. There's no way I can select a few, because my selection is all over the place. Here's my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/my_en">soundcloud account</a>.

<h1>About this blog.</h1>
<p>
  This blog serves as a place for me to throw my thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. out there to the web. I've always been in love with music and figured if I could link up with other like-minded people it would be awesome.
</p>
<p>
  My plan is to break down music, dissect it, feel it, try to interpret it, and hopefully in the process learn more about it myself.
