## Simple and Clean by Utada Hikaru

How could I have forgotten this artist and song! Those days playing __Kingdom Hearts 1__ after school were some of the best. I used to love just watching my brother play and listen to the background music. I also remember listening to this song walking to class (6th grade ish?). So maybe part of the reason why I love this song so much is because of the memories that it brings back.

The opening song for __Kingdom Hearts__ is called _Simple and Clean_ by Utada Hikaru. Yes, this is one of the songs that doesn't really belong to any of the groups i'll probably mention in the future, but something about the song makes me love it so much. It has this sort of gentle grasp on you when you listen to it no matter how many times you _have_ listened to it.

There's a specific part that I absolutely love in the song. It's the chorus, and it goes:

> When you walk away
> You don't here me say,
> "Please, oh baby, don't go."
> Simple and clean is the way that you're
> making me feel tonight
> It's hard to let it go

Something about the key in this song brings out emotion. It's pure art, and perfect for my ears. What actually got me to remember this song and write about it is one of Porter Robinson's mix. It's on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/porter-robinson/porter-robinson-bbc-radio-1-2-hour-essential-mix), and he plays this song __@28:14__.
